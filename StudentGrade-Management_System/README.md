# Student Grade Management System

A simple, interactive C# console application for managing student grades. This project allows users to add students, display all students, search for a student, calculate the average grade, and find the highest and lowest grades among students.

## Features

- **Add Student:** Enter a student's name and grade (0â€“100) to add them to the system.
- **Display All Students:** View a list of all students and their grades.
- **Search Student:** Find a student's grade by entering their name.
- **Calculate Average Grade:** Compute and display the average grade of all students.
- **Find Highest and Lowest Grades:** Display the highest and lowest grades among all students.
- **Exit:** Quit the application.

## How It Works

The application uses a `Dictionary<string, int>` to store student names and their corresponding grades. It presents a menu-driven interface, allowing users to select actions by entering the corresponding number. Input validation ensures grades are between 0 and 100, and handles invalid or empty inputs gracefully.
